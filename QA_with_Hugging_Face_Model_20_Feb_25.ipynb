            "Overview At Monaarch, we are a dedicated team striving to simplify and enhance the user experience in audio manipulation and mastering. Our innovative web application utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as Python Django, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Librosa. Our primary goal is to make professional-grade audio editing accessible to everyone, from hobbyists to seasoned musicians. Services Offered 1.\tVocal Remover: By leveraging TensorFlow models, Monaarch can isolate vocal tracks from instrumental parts or vice versa. This involves training our neural network on a vast dataset of isolated vocal and instrumental tracks, enabling it to accurately separate vocals from background music. 2.\tSplitting Service: ○\tBasic Splitting: Our app can split music into voice, drums, bass, and other components using pre-trained models. This segmentation is achieved by analyzing the audio file's frequency spectrum and isolating the distinct sound patterns of each instrument. ○\tAdvanced Splitting: This service further refines the splitting process to include vocals, piano, drums, bass, guitar, and other instruments. The advanced model is trained on a more diverse dataset to recognize and separate these additional instruments accurately. 3.\tMixing and Mastering: Users can upload unmastered songs to be automatically mixed and mastered. We employ sophisticated digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and sound processing algorithms from Librosa to balance audio levels, enhance sound quality, and apply effects. Users can also tweak parameters or use preset settings to achieve the desired output. 4.\tChord Extraction: Monaarch utilizes machine learning models to analyze single instrument sounds and extract chords, which are then converted into MIDI files. This involves identifying pitch, timbre, and harmonic structures within the audio file, allowing for accurate chord extraction.\n",

This involves identifying pitch, timbre, and harmonic structures within the audio file, allowing for accurate chord extraction. Technology Stack ●\tFrontend: We use React.js or Vue.js for a responsive and user-friendly interface. ●\tBackend: Django is employed for robust server-side logic and seamless integration with the frontend. ●\tMachine Learning: PyTorch and TensorFlow are utilized for developing and training neural networks to perform audio separation and processing tasks. ●\tAudio Processing: Librosa is used for analyzing and manipulating audio signals, utilizing DSP and principles from physics and mathematics to maintain high audio fidelity. ●\tCloud Services: AWS is chosen for reliable storage and processing capabilities, ensuring scalability and performance. ●\tDatabase: We recommend using PostgreSQL for its robustness and scalability. PostgreSQL will handle user data and service records efficiently. Streamlit Version We also have a Streamlit version of Monaarch, where various services can be tested on a private server. This version is ideal for rapid prototyping, internal testing, and providing a sandbox environment for users to explore the capabilities of the platform.\n",
